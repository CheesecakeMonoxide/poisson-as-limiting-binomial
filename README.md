<h2>Using the Poisson distribution to predict the next occurrence of a super typhoon in the Philippines</h2>

After learning that GitHub sometimes could not load jupyter notebooks for some reason, I am sharing the nbviewer link below for your convenience:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CheesecakeMonoxide/poisson-as-limiting-binomial/blob/master/Exercise%20-%20Poisson%20Distribution%20to%20Predict%20Next%20Occurrence%20of%20a%20Super%20Typhoon.ipynb?flush_cache=true


The following exercise is an attempt to explore the Poisson probability distribution function as well as minor data clean-ups using pandas.

Motivation for studying: I'm curious to know when the next big disaster caused by some tropical depression is about to happen in the Philippines.
